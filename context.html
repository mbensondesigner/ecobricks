<h2>Context for Ecobricking</h2>

<p>The global ecobrick movement has emerged as the result of a number of local initiatives in different locations around the world in response to the perceived challenges associated with the management of plastic waste. As economic petroleum consumption and plastic production have increased,[7] and as industrial waste management methods have struggled to keep pace, ecobricking has emerged as a local, non-industrial solution.</p>
<h3>20th Century Plastic Development</h3>

<p>Petroleum-derived energy has enabled the growth of the global economy over the last hundred years. The widespread adoption of fossil fuels has enabled transportation and material technologies to develop. However, in the refinement of crude oil, 4-13% cannot be processed into high value, high energy fuels.[8] This by-product is useful as a feedstock for the ultra-cheap production of plastic polymers. Since 1950 an estimated 8,300 million metric tons (Mt) of virgin plastics have been produced worldwide; 9% of which had been recycled, 12% were incinerated and 79% have accumulated in landfills or the natural environment.</p>
<h3>Petroleum Projections</h3>

<p>According to the American Chemistry Council, since 2010 $186bn dollars is being invested in 318 new projects to fuel a 40% increase in plastic production over the next decade.[10] If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.[9] In addition, by 2030, CO
2 emissions from the production, processing and disposal of plastic could reach 1.34 gigatons per yearâ€”equivalent to the emissions released by more than 295 new 500-megawatt coal-fired power plants.</p>
<h3>Plastic Pollution and Contamination</h3>

<p>A tremendous amount of plastic waste litters our planet every year, and its cost is huge. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 2014 Yearbook, plastic contamination threatens marine life, tourism, fisheries and businesses and the overall natural capital cost for plastic waste is $75 billion each year.[12] Increasing scientific documentation is demonstrating many dangers arising from plastic degradation. When plastic enters the biosphere it releases toxins, fragments into microplastics and emits greenhouse gases that interfere with ecological cycles.[13] When plastic is burned or incinerated, toxic gases like dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls are released into the atmosphere.[14] Photo-oxidative degradation caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and physical abrasion fragments plastic debris into smaller and smaller particles, known as microplastics.[15] The degradation process corresponds directly to the amount of surface area of the plastic that is exposed as well as the length of time of exposure to UV rays. The majority of non-recyclable single use plastics are sheets and films with large surface areas and are highly susceptible to photodegration. The photodegradation process also emits greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene.</p>

<p>Microplastics can have possible direct ecotoxicological impacts, accumulate in food chains and cause economic damage because of food safety concerns.[17] Burned and incinerated plastics have been shown to release dioxins and other chemicals that are harmful to human health.</p>
<h3>Rural Community Impact</h3>

<p>In countries and communities without access to industrial recycling or incineration, plastic has accumulated in streets, ditches and beaches. Without large scale options for managing plastic households and communities have been powerless to manage their own plastic, other than dangers and intoxicating low-temperature incineration, water and land loose dumping.</p>
<h3>Failure of Industrial Recycling</h3>

<p>Between, 1950 and 2017 an estimated 8,300 million metric tons (Mt) of virgin plastics have been produced worldwide; only 9% were recycled, the rest have been dumped or burned.[9] As of the early 2000s most industrial recycling was occurring in China where the majority of G7 countries were exporting their waste plastic.[19] The processing of this plastic, in particular the dumping and incineration of unrecyclables, caused significant pollution in China.[20] As of January 1, 2018, China banned plastic imports in its National Sword program.[21] Since then, globally, more plastics are now ending up in landfills, incinerators, or likely littering the environment as rising costs to haul away recyclable materials increasingly render the practice unprofitable.[22] The displaced plastic exports from Europe and America has been largely diverted to Indonesia, Turkey, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam [23] where lacking environmental regulations have resulted in wholesale air, water and earth pollution around processing plants.[24] Critics observe that industrial recycling relies on the energy intensive export of plastic to other locations, that industrial recycling isn't a circular (processes turn a high grade plastic into a lower, less-recyclable form), and that recycling enables the unquestioned continuation of plastic consumtion</p>

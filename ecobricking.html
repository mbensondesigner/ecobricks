<h2>The Ecobricking of Plastic</h2>

<p>The ecobricking movement has emerged from a growing awareness of the scale of plastic pollution, the problems it causes and the inability of industrial means to adequately manage plastic waste [27] The ecobricking movement promotes techniques, methodologies and applications as a means for households, communities and cities [28] to take responsibility for their plastic, secure and transform it. Ecobricks serve to sequester plastic, to put the plastic to use locally as building block, and as an alternative medium of community exchange</p>
<h3>Terminal Minimization of Net Surface Area</h3>

<p>By packing plastic into a bottle, flat high-surface area wrappers and films are compressed together. This terminal minimization of net surface area means that the plastic is secured from the principal forms of potential degradation: heat, burning, friction and photodegradation.[30] In addition, by ensuring that only clean and dry plastic is packed and permanently sealing the bottle, potential microbial degradation is also prevented.</p>
<h3>Sequestration of Plastic</h3>

<p>When ecobricks are properly made and properly applied in cradle to cradle design constructions they result in the effective sequestration,[32] of plastic out of the biosphere. In other words, ecobricks serve as a way to trap and secure plastic from entering the environment, degrading and causing ecological harm.[33] In short-term ecobrick applications, such as milstein[34] or Dieleman Modules [35] ecobricks can be used for up to three years without any damage to the bottle. By using silicone sealant[36] or inner-tube-bands[37] as short-term, non-permanent attachment methods, the ecobricks can be extricated undamaged at the construction's end and used again in another short or long-term applications.[38] In particular, the long-term earth and ecobrick building method,[39] results in gardens, parks, and earthen walls that ensure that the ecobricked plastic is fully secured. Earthen mortar will easily crumble when the structure is disassembled ensuring that the ecobricks can be extricated and reused.[40] Earthen mortar also completely covers the ecobrick negating any possibility of heat, friction, fire or microbial degradation.[41] Ecobrick sequestration thus prevents the breakdown of the contained plastic into microplastics[42] and into green house gases through photodegradation.[43] Ecobrick sequestration also prevents the incineration of the plastic and the release of gases and CO
2[44] It is estimated that for each 1 kg of ecobricked plastic, 3.1 kg of CO
2 is sequestered.</p>
<h3>The Raising of Ecological Consciousness</h3>

<p>In contrast to industrial plastic management technologies, ecobriking directly involves the consumers of plastic in its process. The process of saving, segregating, washing, drying and packing plastic results in consumer/ecobricker reflection[46] The meditative and communal tendencies of ecobricking raise individual and collective ‘ecological consciousness’ over time.[47][48] Ecobrickers tend to pursue more information about waste disposal in their community, plastic, recycling and ecobricking topics. This leads to a steady decrease in the ecobricker's net plastic consumption.</p>
<h3>The Global Ecobrick Alliance</h3>

<p>In 2013 leaders of disparate national ecobricks movements connected with each other to establish consistency and accord in the global movement. Russell Maier, Jo Stodgel, Candice Mostert, Patricia Acuna and Irene Bakisan were instrumental in the founding of the Global Ecobrick Alliance (GEA) and the initial goal of creating the Vision Ecobrick Guidebook. In 2014, with the support of Ian Domisse, founder of the Ecobrick Exchange in South Africa, they agreed to use the non-hyphenated, non-capitalize term 'ecobrick' as the consistent, standardized term of reference in the guidebook and their materials. In this way, ecobrickers around the world would be able to refer with one word to same concept and web searches and hashtags would accelerate global dissemination. After the completion of the guidebook, Russell Maier continued the development of the GEA. The GEA is a not for profit, principled Earth Enterprise with the mission of supporting the technological and philosophical infrastructure of the global ecobrick movement. The GEA maintains Ecobricks.org as a go to resource for ecobrick methods, best practices and principles. The GEA maintains and develops the free GoBrik.com web app to support and connect ecobrickers and their communities. The GEA has launched and maintains the Brikcoin manual blockchain as a means to value the plastic sequestration service of ecobrickers and to develop a medium of exchange based on the value of secured plastic.</p>

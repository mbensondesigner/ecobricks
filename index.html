<p>An ecobrick is a plastic bottle packed with used plastic to set density to create a reusable building block. Ecobricks can be used to produce modular items, including furniture, garden walls and other structures.[1] Ecobricks are produced primarily as a means of managing plastic waste by sequestering it and containing it safely, by terminally reducing the net surface area of the packed plastic to effectively secure the plastic from degrading into toxins and microplastics. Ecobricking is a both an individual and collaborative endeavour. The ecobricking movement promotes the personal ecobricking process as a means to raise awareness of the consequences of consumption and the dangers of plastic. It also promotes the collaborative process as a means to encourage communities to take collective responsibility for their plastic waste and to use it to produce a useful product.[2]</p>

<p>To enable the production of ecobricks at minimal environmental cost, the Global Ecobrick Alliance promotes low-technology methods that do not require capital, fuel, electricity, or specialized equipment. Typically, producers use a wood or bamboo stick to manually pack plastic into the plastic bottle.[3] Any size of transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottle can be used to make an ecobrick. The bottle and the packed plastic are clean and dry to prevent the growth of bacteria. Plastic is cut or ripped into small pieces then packed little by little, alternating between adding the plastic and compacting it, layer by layer. The bottle is rotated with each press to ensure the plastic is evenly compacted throughout the bottle. This helps prevent voids and that the packing reaches the requisite solidity needed for a building block applications.[4] Completed ecobricks are packed solid enough that they can bear the weight of a person without deforming—a density range between 0.33g/ml and 0.7g/ml.[5] Maximizing density minimizes the flammability of the ecobrick[6] while increasing its durability and re-usability.

	<h2>History</h2>

<p>TThe packing of plastic into bottles to sequester plastic and to make building blocks has arisen independently in locations around the world as a local solution to plastic pollution[clarification needed]. Filling bottles with plastic waste builds upon the bottle building techniques of German architect Andreas Froese (using sand-filled PET bottles) in South America in 2000. Alvaro Molina began packing plastic into bottles on the island of Ometepe in 2003. Susana Heisse, in Guatemala began to encourage ecobricking in 2003 as a building technique and for solving plastic pollution challenges faced in Lake Atitlan communities.</p>

<p>TIn 2010, in the Northern Philippines, Russell Maier and Irene Bakisan[67] developed a curriculum guide of simplified and recommended practices to help local schools integrate eco-bricks into their curriculum. Applying the ancestral ecological principles of the Igorots for building rice terraces, they integrated cradle-to-cradle principles into ecobrick methodology: ensuring that ecobricks can be reused at the end of the construction they are used in.[68] Through the Department of Education, the guide was distributed to 1,700 schools in 2014.</p>

<p>TThe open source development of ecobrick best practices and innovations that emerged from the Filipino movement became the genesis for the Global Ecobrick Alliance as founded by Russell Maier, Joseph Stodgel and Candice Mostert. The Global Ecobrick Alliance continues to develop and maintain the conceptual and technological infrastructure of the global ecobrick movement as an Earth Enterprise.</p>

<p>TMovements in South Africa began in 2012, when Joseph Stodgel brought the concept to Greyton, throwing an annual Trash to Treasure festival at the local dumpsite with South African, Candice Mostert, who started local school projects under Greyton transition town building with the bricks made by the community. The movement has since grown in South Africa, with organizations like Waste-ED, founded by Candice Mostert, who works both in Zambia and Cape Towns surrounds to educate people about plastic and its value, and the architect Ian Dommisse as the Ecobrick Exchange.
Ecobricks can be used to build community garden spaces.</p>

<h2>Case studies</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In the village of Besao in the Northern Philippines, hospital custodian Jane Liwan set about packing one ecobrick a day to revamp her ailing home that her neighbors had been ridiculing. Two years later her home is a tourist attraction that has been featured in both local and national media.</li>
    <li>On the isolated volcano island of Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua, Alvaro Molina, distraught by the plastic waste that had nowhere to go in his community, began eco bricking at his hotel. His community is now one of the cleanest in the country, with dozens of local schools building with ecobricks and a micro-economy formed around ecobrick buying and selling.</li>
    <li>In New Mexico, USA, Jo Stodgel has run a community ecobrick project since 2014 through his organization Upcycle Santa Fe. The organization conducts regular ecobrick river cleanups, has built a number of structures at local schools, and also completed an important research project with Los Alamos National Laboratory regarding the offgassing of ecobricks. His organization also encourages the usage of milk cartons as well as bottles to make ecobricks.</li>
    <li>In Serbia, math professor Tomislav Radovanovic spent five years turning 13,500 plastic bottles into his dream home. The teacher's former students helped him.</li>
    <li>The Alfredo Santa Cruz family of Puerto Iguazu, Argentina, made their home almost entirely from thousands of plastic bottles. Walls, coffee tables, bed platforms and even the steps to get to the front door are made of plastic bottles.</li>

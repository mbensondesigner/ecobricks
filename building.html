<h2>Ecobrick Building Applications</h2>

<p>Ecobricks can be connected using tire bands, silicone, cob, and cement to build furniture, gardens, structures and more.[51] Ecobricks are being used in different ways around the world. Ideally, ecobrick constructions use cradle to cradle design methods of combining the bottlesâ€”ensuring that the ecobricks can be extricated without compromise to the bottle at the end of the construction's life span.[52] It is useful to differentiate between short-term ecobrick and long term ecobrick applications</p>

<h3>Short-term Applications</h3>

<p>Ecobricks can be combined together using tire bands[53] or inner-tube-bands[37] as short-term, non-permanent attachment methods to create applications that last months to several years. As short-term applications are not usually covered, such constructions are typically for indoor use, in order to prevent UV photodegration of the bottles. Short-term applications range from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ecobrick Milstein Modules: Hexagon and triangle modules that are used for sitting, but can be combined together to form one or two level horizontal surfaces. Applications include tables, beds, stages, etc.</li>
    <li>Ecobrick Dieleman Modules: A geometric configuration of 16 ecobricks that enables a stackable LEGO module. These modules can be stacked horizontally and vertically indefinitely. Applications include indoor playgrounds, temporary stalls, sheds, and circular structure.</li>
    <li>Ecobrick Open Spaces: A combination of hundreds of Milstein and Dieleman lego modules that enable the creation of interactive social spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-term Applications</h3>

<p>Ecobricks can be used with Earth building techniques (i.e. cob, wattle and daub, and adobe) to create structures that can last years or decades (it is not uncommon for traditional earth constructions to last centuries).[58] In this way, earth mixes are used in between horizontally laid ecobricks as mortar.[59] Ecobricks can also used vertically and with traditional construction techniques in the Pura Vida Atlan style of building.[60] Both methods are careful to avoid the complete covering of ecobricks with cement which upon the end of the construction results in the destruction of ecobricks upon extrication.[61] Examples of long-term ecobrick applications include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Raised gardens: Ecobricks are laid horizontal and completely covered </li>
    <li>Raised benches: Two or three levels of horizontally laid ecobricks to make seats and benches.</li>
    <li>Food Forest Play Parks: A combination of raised beds and benches to make a public green space, ideally filled with edible plants.</li>
    <li>Walls: Ecobricks can be laid horizontal with earth mortar to build vertical walls. The walls can between standing posts and beams or as a circular standing structure. Alternatively, the pura vida method, uses chicken wire between posts to make walls from enclosed vertically standing ecobricks.</li>
